## Question 1

## Question 2
Question 2 gives us a str of letters and numbers and asks us to decode this problem. Looking at this string, we see it ends with a double "==" which is typically seen in base 64. As a result, it is likely it should be encoded in base 64 and we should use a base 64 decoder accordingly. This can be found by simply googling a calculator online.

## Question 3
This question gives you a simple description, Meta Meta Meta and a bunch of task files to download. Downloading them in, you see that you get an image file. This should get you to think about something known as metadata. It is something that every image that you take with your phone contains and is on most images online unless they were stripped away by the website. Depending on what OS you are using there are different ways of getting the meta data from this image. (something something something) After you get that you should be able to find the flag inside the image.
## Question 4

## Question 5
This question is a bit obscure since it only gives you close to no hints about it. Perhaps if you were bored, you may have been highlighting around the question and you may see something interesting.
## Question 6
## Question 7
## Question 8
## Question 10
Question 10 is very intersting and may remind you of question 5. Essentially the trick around this question is to go into the HTML of the site and look at the div under Task 10. Look down far enough and you will be able to find the key you need in a paragraph tag. 
## Question 11
## Question 12
## Question 13
## Question 14
## Question 15
## Question 16
## Question 17
## Question 18
This question's prompt says `Sometimes we need a 'machine' to dig the past` and provides us with a website and date. This is referring to the popular web archive website, the wayback machine. In case you don't know how it works, it is essentially a site where you can paste URLs of websites into it and see how the website looked like in the past. Pasting the URL given to the wayback machine and going to January 2, 2020 gives us what we need to get the flag.
